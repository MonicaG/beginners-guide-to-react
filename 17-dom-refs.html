  <!-- 
    The problem: In this example we are using a 3rd party js library: VanillaTilt.js. The library animates an 
    element when it is moused over. However, in our Tilt component the `tilt-root` is a React element, not a DOM node. 
    React takes that element and renders it to the DOM. So, we need to get the DOM node created by React so we can
    wire up the VanillaTilt.js to it.
    
    The solution: Use react refs. See https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html
  -->
  <script type="text/babel">
    function Tilt({children}) {

      /*
      useRef() takes an optional initialValue parameter.  It returns a ref object whose `current` property is initialized
      to that value. In this example it will be the `tilt-root` DOM node. The object returned is a plain JS object. 
      */
      const tiltRef = React.useRef()
      /*
      the useEffect hook is used because it runs after the DOM has been updated. Which is what we need because 
      now we can get the DOM node for the `tilt-root` element and apply  VanillaTilt.js to it.
      The useRef has a current property that we can mutate without triggering a re-render of our component, in this
      case the Tilt component. We can use refs for more than just DOM nodes. We can use it for any value that we want 
      to keep track of and mutate over time without triggering a re-render of our component.

        const tiltNode = tiltRef.current

          /*
          In this example, if the checkbox is unchecked then the DOM node is removed from the page. However,
          all the event handlers on that node still exist and there are references to the node in the VanillaTilt
          java script code.  This uses up memory.  So, we return a function that will remove references to our
          DOM node in the VanillaTilt js and remove all event handlers.
          This function will be called on every update of the Tilt component. Which in this example is triggered
          when the checkbox is checked/unchecked.

      The above dependency array is empty because nothing is updated. However, we need to provide it because otherwise
      the useEffect hook would run with each re-render of the Tilt component. We don't want it to run because all it does 
      is initialize and destory the VanillaTilt. But the VanillaTilt is not changed in any way in this example. So, it
      is not optimal to be creating and destroying for each re-render. So, the empty depedency array says to run the 
      hook when the Tilt component is initially mounted (added) to the DOM and run it when it is unmounted 
      (removed) from the DOM.
