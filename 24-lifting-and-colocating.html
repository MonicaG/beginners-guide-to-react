  /*
   Lifting state - moving state from the component to the "least common parent". For example, when multiple child 
   components need access to the same state, the state will need to be at a parent component that is common to 
   both. It should also be at the parent that is closest to both (not way up in the heirarchy)

   This is all very similar to SwiftUI and its managing of state and single source of truth.

   Co-locating state is moving state down to a child component because it is not needed at a parent level. This 
   may happen when the requirements change, and state that was previously needed across multiple components
   is only needed in one component now.

   In this example the App component is the source of truth for the `name` state as it is used in multiple components,
   (Name and Display components.) The FavoriteAnimal controls the `animal` state as only that component uses it.
