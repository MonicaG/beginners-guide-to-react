      /*
      The problem we are solving in this example: We've created an App component
      that uses this Greeting component. That App component also has state. When that
      state changes, the Greeting component is also re-rendered. This means the useEffect 
      hook is run, even though the `name` has not changed. This can be inefficient as we 
      are updating localStorage when we don't need to, as nothing changed. 
      
      The solution: Use a dependency array so the effect only runs when the state it depends on
      changes. Here, we rely on the name state only, and so it is provided in the array
      
      Note: Use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks plugin to ensure
      you are using hooks correctly. Part of the check is to ensure your dependcy array values
      match the state used in your effect.
