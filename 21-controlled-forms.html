    This example uses a controlled-component for creating the form. The 19-basic-forms.html and
    20-dynamic-forms.html used uncontrolled-componet to create their forms. React generally recommends
    using controlled-components for making forms.
    See: https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components

    The problem: Rather than allowing a user to enter an upper case letter and displaying a warning message,
    we want to prevent the user from entering an upper case letter at all. If they try to enter an uppercase
    letter, then change it to a lowercase letter automatically. We want the user to see the letter being converted
    to lower case as they type.

    The solution: use a controlled-component for the form. From the react docs:
    In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and 
    update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept with the component, and updated with
    useState hook. We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React 
    component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form 
    element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
