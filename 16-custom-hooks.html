  /*
  The problem: using local storage maybe something we want to use in other components. We don't want to 
  duplicate the code across multiple components

  The solution: Refactor the useState and useEffect hooks into a function that can be used by any component.
  By convention prefix the function name with 'use'. This will allow the  https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks 
  plugin to run the hooks checks on your custom hook functions.
