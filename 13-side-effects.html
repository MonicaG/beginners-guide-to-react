      The `useEffect` Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. In this example, we want
      to have the entered value saved in localStorage so on a page refresh, that value will be retrieved
      and displayed. This is called a side effect. 
      When React renders the Greeting component, it will remember the effect below, and run it after updating 
      the DOM. This happens for every render, including the first one.
      Effects scheduled with useEffect donâ€™t block the browser from updating the screen
      See: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
